# Module 1 - Network Security Techniques

This module introduces you to network security techniques, including firewall technologies, stateless and stateful inspections, IDS, and IPS systems. Youâ€™ll also examine Network Address Translation (NAT) and file integrity monitoring, along with advanced security measures such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Network Access Control, and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). You'll conclude this module with a hands-on lab where you can gain real-world experience with an open-source Extended Detection and Response (XDR) application.

## Stateless Inspectiona 
Stateless inspection means that the devices inspect each data packet individually at both the source and destination ports without knowledge of the previous packet. Stateless inspections can happen when a user sends or receives browser data. Organizations use stateless inspections to control traffic going in or out of their organization, perform network troubleshooting, control traffic routing, and perform quality of service and class of service tasks. Stateless inspection is faster than stateful inspection, providing network controls and support for troubleshooting purposes when classifying packets.

## Stateful inspection
Stateful inspection or dynamic packet filtering is a firewall technology to ensure smooth flow of network packets. Stateful inspection involves inspecting each packet in a session. A session consists of packets exchanged between parties. Session elements include source IP address, the destination IP address, the source port, the destination port, and an identifier. The stateless inspection is performed before stateful inspection.

## Firewall Filters with Intrusion Systems
Firewall filters enforce security policies to regulate inbound and outbound network traffic. Firewall filter types include stateless, stateful, and application level firewalls. Intrusion detection systems continuously scan network traffic and system activities for signs of suspicious behavior. While firewall filters enforce static security policies, IDS and IPS systems add dynamic layers of protection, actively monitoring and preventing potential intrusions or malicious activities.

## Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems Compared
IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats and generates alerts, while IPS uses predefined actions to prevent attacks. IDS systems have little to no impact on the network and IPS can affect network performance. IDS provides detailed analysis and alerts but can generate false positives and, without automatic interception capabilities, require human intervention. IPS provides real-time threat prevention and mitigation but can impact network performance and report false positives. And both IDS and IPS are part of a layered defense.

## Network Address Translation
Network address translation modifies IP address information in packet headers to mask internal IP addresses for outbound data and translates public IP addresses back to private addresses for inbound data. NAT provides a layer of security against external threats by hiding internal IP addresses. Static NAT, dynamic NAT, and port address translation (PAT) are three types of network address translations. You can use NAT to mask internal IP addresses for devices sending and receiving data and for devices on networks that need to share IP addresses but use different ports. And common NAT issues include port forwarding problems, IP address conflicts, and performance overhead.

## File Integrity Monitoring
File integrity monitoring is crucial for maintaining system security and quickly detecting unauthorized changes that may indicate breaches or malicious activity. Core components and processes for FIM include establishing a reliable file system baseline, monitoring file integrity, providing reports, and maintaining the system, and file integrity monitoring complements other security measures such as firewalls and antivirus solutions to provide a robust defense strategy.

## Data Loss Prevention
DLP tools prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity for sensitive information. They monitor and block unauthorized data transfers across all data states. DLP ensures compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, reducing data breach risks. Core DLP elements include: data classification, policy enforcement, and continuous monitoring, and DLP technologies analyze content, evaluate context, and use encryption for data protection.

## Network Access Control
Network access control, NAC, ensures that only authorized devices access network resources, reducing security risks. NAC verifies device compliance with security policies, like antivirus updates and enhanced network protection. Implementation involves deploying NAC components, defining access policies, and testing for effective security enforcement. NAC responds to violations by monitoring, isolating non-compliant devices, and automating remediation processes. Integrated with firewalls and antivirus, NAC strengthens network security and meets regulatory compliance standards.

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
Endpoint detection and response, EDR, is a set of cybersecurity tools and practices for detecting, investigating, and responding to suspicious activities on desktops, laptops, servers, and mobile devices. EDR provides detailed visibility and advanced detection techniques, enabling security teams to quickly identify, contain, and respond to sophisticated threats more effectively. Key EDR components and processes include data collection, data analysis, threat detection, investigation and related analysis, and response and remediation. 
To integrate EDR, evaluate the organization's endpoint security needs, deploy the EDR agents, define security policies and rules, and monitor and manage the system. EDR is one part of a comprehensive data protection strategy, and EDR provides detailed visibility and control into data activities required for compliance with legal and regulatory security standards.

## Extended Detection and Response
Extended detection and response platforms extend endpoint detection and response capabilities by incorporating information from a broader range of security tools, XDR integration capabilities improve threat detection, leading to faster investigations and incident response times by the organization's IT environment, key XDR capabilities include data aggregation, correlation and analysis, threat detection, investigation, forensics, and automated responses, to implement the XDR platform, assess the organization's needs and resources, plan the deployment strategy, deploy and configure the platform, define and configure policies, and continuously monitor and manage the platform, network integration capabilities complement other security measures and enhance visibility and control, and XDR platforms help organizations avoid legal repercussions and maintain customer and stakeholder trust by providing detailed logs, reports, audit trails, and security event documentation.
