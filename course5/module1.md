# Module 1 - Network Security Techniques

This module introduces you to network security techniques, including firewall technologies, stateless and stateful inspections, IDS, and IPS systems. Youâ€™ll also examine Network Address Translation (NAT) and file integrity monitoring, along with advanced security measures such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Network Access Control, and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). You'll conclude this module with a hands-on lab where you can gain real-world experience with an open-source Extended Detection and Response (XDR) application.

## Learning Objectives
- Define network address translation (NAT)
- Explain how to configure systems to monitor cybersecurity events
- Implement and compare firewall technologies, including stateless and stateful inspections, IDS, and IPS systems
- Apply advanced security measures such as Network Address Translation (NAT), Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Network Access Control, and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR/XDR)
- Define the purpose of isolating affected systems during a data breach
- Describe File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- Discuss Network Address Control (NAC)
- Summarize endpoint detection and response
- Define stateless firewall
- Compare Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS)
- Discuss stateless Network Address Translation (NAT)

## Stateless Inspectiona 
Stateless inspection means that the devices inspect each data packet individually at both the source and destination ports without knowledge of the previous packet. Stateless inspections can happen when a user sends or receives browser data. Organizations use stateless inspections to control traffic going in or out of their organization, perform network troubleshooting, control traffic routing, and perform quality of service and class of service tasks. Stateless inspection is faster than stateful inspection, providing network controls and support for troubleshooting purposes when classifying packets.
