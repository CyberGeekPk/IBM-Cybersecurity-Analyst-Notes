# Module 1 - Network Fundamentals
In this module, you’ll learn about networking hardware, including routers and switches. You'll gain essential job-ready knowledge of wireless networking standards. Learn about basic network design and gain practical experience designing and drawing a basic network structure based on requirements. You'll also engage in practical identification exercises about network ports, protocols, and protocol tables that you’ll need to understand key networking models.

## Learning Objectives
- Describe various network devices
- Design a basic network structure
- Identify the uses for network ports and protocols
- Explain the purpose of a protocol table
- Describe networking models, standards, protocols, and ports
- Differentiate the purposes for various network hardware devices
- Identify wireless networks and standards

## Computer Networks: Networking Hardware Devices
Network devices, which can be a variety of different types, enable communication and interaction on a network. Servers are powerful computers that store files and applications and are accessed by other computers on the same network. Nodes and clients can be configured in different ways. Routers and modems transmit and convert data to ensure interconnections happen and information reaches its destination correctly. And firewalls, proxy servers, IDS, and IPS work to keep networks secure. 

## Models, Standards, Protocols, and Ports
Network models in OSI and TCP/IP describe the design used to establish network communication. Network standards define the rules for data communication and ensure broader compatibility. Network protocols are based on an established set of rules for data transmission. Sockets use ports and protocols to facilitate communication between network devices.

## Computer Networks: Wireless Networks and Standards
WPANs use IEEE 802.15 for nearby devices, WLANs use IEEE 802.11 for home or office networks, WMANs use IEEE 802.15 for city or campus networks, WWANs supply regional or global networks. WANETs are land-sized temporary mobile networks. Cellular networks have evolved over time to become faster and more efficient. IEEE 802.20 and 802.22 are the standards for WWANs, WANETs, and cellular networks.
