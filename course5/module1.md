# Module 1 - Network Fundamentals
In this module, you’ll learn about networking hardware, including routers and switches. You'll gain essential job-ready knowledge of wireless networking standards. Learn about basic network design and gain practical experience designing and drawing a basic network structure based on requirements. You'll also engage in practical identification exercises about network ports, protocols, and protocol tables that you’ll need to understand key networking models.

## Learning Objectives

- Design a basic network structure
- Identify the uses for network ports and protocols
- Explain the purpose of a protocol table
- Describe networking models, standards, protocols, and ports
- Differentiate the purposes for various network hardware devices
- Identify wireless networks and standards

## Computer Networks: Networking Hardware Devices
Network devices, which can be a variety of different types, enable communication and interaction on a network. Servers are powerful computers that store files and applications and are accessed by other computers on the same network. Nodes and clients can be configured in different ways. Routers and modems transmit and convert data to ensure interconnections happen and information reaches its destination correctly. And firewalls, proxy servers, IDS, and IPS work to keep networks secure.
