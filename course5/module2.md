# Module 2 - IP Addressing, Routing & Switching
After completing this module, you will be able to explain and apply IP addressing, IP address structure and network classes, IP protocols, traffic routing, and the IPv6 address schema. You’ll also be able to compare the structure and uses of IPv4 and IPv6. You’ll be able to explain basic network routing principles, Layer 2 and Layer 3 addressing, and Address Resolution Protocols (ARP) and describe the basics of routers and routing table sessions. You'll gain experience you can use in the real world when you learn how to secure a small office/home office (SOHO) network.
