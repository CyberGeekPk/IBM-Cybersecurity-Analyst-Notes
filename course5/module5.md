# Module 5 - Final Project

## Learning Objectives
- Design a network with subnets
- Configure Firewall Rules Using Microsoft Windows Defender Firewall
- Analyze HTTP/HTTPS Website Traffic for Using Wireshark
- Calculate Subnet Addresses and Subnet Masks

## Final Project Overview

In this final project you'll apply your skills to a real-life scenario where you help a company set up a new network. Based on what youâ€™ve learned in this course. you'll provide detailed recommendations,  strategies, and justifications for the following network planning considerations:

- Design a network with subnets
- Calculate subnet addresses and subnet masks
- Analyze HTTP/HTTPS Traffic for one website using Wireshark
- Configure firewall rules using Microsoft Windows Defender  Firewall

## Final project requirements:
If you decide to try this poject on your own machine, you will need access to:

- A workstation running Microsoft Windows 10 or later
- Administrator rights to the workstation

## Scenario:
TechSafe, Ltd. has hired you to design and secure its network. The company uses a fixed IP address from its Internet service provider (ISP) and wants a structured network with compatible IP addressing, subnetting, and security configurations.

## Task 1: Design a network with subnets
Scenario: Design a network diagram for TechSafe Ltd that includes three departments: Administration, Sales, and IT. Each department requires its own subnet.
### Deliverable: A screenshot of the network diagram.
- One router connected to one switch. The router connects to the switch with a line. Label the router as Router and label the switch as Switch.
- Three subnets that connect to the switch using solid lines The three subnets are labeled as Administration, Sales, and IT.
- The diagram includes no additional elements beyond the router, switch, and subnets.
