# Module 3 - Network Protocols
In this module, you'll learn about network protocols and security measures, combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications. You will begin with an introduction to application and transport protocols, focusing on UDP and TCP. You will then explore DNS and DHCP and experience a hands-on lab for configuring DHCP and an activity on DNS filtering. Then learn how to use Syslog message logs and network analysis techniques, including port mirroring, promiscuous mode, and user behavior analysis.

## Learning Objectives
- Describe how broadcasting domains are used
- Differentiate between collision and broadcast domains
- Describe the event attributes to include in event logs
- Identify the legitimate and illegitimate uses of port mirroring
- Explain how to use flow utilities such as NetFlow to collect and visualize network traffic flow statistics on routing devices
- Define the Syslog protocol
- Describe the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), including the service that it provides
- Describe the domain name system (DNS), including the service that it provides
- Analyze network traffic using techniques such as port mirroring, promiscuous mode, and user behavior analysis
- Differentiate between the TCP and UDP transport layer protocols
- Identify a protocol associated with TCP
- Describe common uses for UDP
- Demonstrate DNS and DHCP installation and configuration
- Explain how user behavior analysis helps secure networks
- Discuss how networks use port mirroring and promiscuous mode
- Discuss how to apply DNS filtering
- Explain network flow, including NetFlow analysis capabilities
- Describe how networks use the Syslog Messaging protocol
- Demonstrate how to configure and manage DNS and DHCP services
- Differentiate between how networks use UDP and TCP transport protocols
