- Identify application security concerns
- Identify browsing risks on public WIFI, social networks, instant messaging, and secure websites
- Explain how to configure browser settings for secure management of cookies, plug-ins, cache, extensions, and updates
- Demonstrate safe browsing techniques, including how to recognize safe websites, suspicious ads, links, and other warnings

## Quick Tips to Identify Safe Websites
Staying safe online is more important than ever â€” especially with the rise in scams and phishing sites. Here are a few easy ways to protect yourself when browsing:

- Use Whois Lookup â€“ Check who owns the domain. No contact info? ðŸš©
- Look for Reviews â€“ Platforms like Reddit often call out shady or risky websites.
- Stick to HTTPS â€“ Always check for the padlock icon ðŸ”’ in the browser. No HTTPS? Your data isnâ€™t secure.
- Verify Trust Seals â€“ Click on them to confirm theyâ€™re legit, not just an image.
- Inspect URLs and Design â€“ Typos, strange layouts, or suspicious links can be warning signs of malicious sites.

## Summary & Highlights
- Apps and devices are secured with strong passwords, antivirus, VPN software. and firewalls. Hackers target sensitive data, intellectual property, trade secrets, and financial data for profit. Multifactor authentication and additional layers of security help to keep data and devices secure.
- Public WIFI is unsecure. Hackers can see and intercept any data you send or receive in plain text. Hackers and scammers also target social networking sites, text messages, and instant messenger services. Websites using HTTPS in their URLs do encrypt their connections but that doesnâ€™t ensure the site is safe.
- Hackers target browsers because theyâ€™re your gateway to the Internet. Keep your browser and any plug-ins or extensions updated to avoid exploits. All browsers allow you to manage privacy and security settings including cookies, cache, and browsing history. Click the lock icon in a websiteâ€™s URL to see who owns the security certificate to verify ownership and other information.
- Autofill stores your personal and payment information in your browser. Browsers can cache downloaded pages for faster loading the next time you visit the website. Private browsing doesnâ€™t store cookies, browsing history, or cached webpages. Websites using HTTPS encrypt your data, but donâ€™t guarantee that the site isnâ€™t compromised. Adware can collect data, track online activity, link to malicious sites, and degrade system performance. Search engine algorithms can detect dangerous websites.
