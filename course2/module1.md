# Common Security Threats and Risks

This module will teach you the skills you need to 
- Identify basic security threats
- Choose the best security practices to address those threats
- Difference between data, information, and insights and how companies leverage all three to help guide their business decisions
- Maintain data integrity and keep data confidential
- Different types of attacks and breaches that threaten today’s organizations and their data

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to keep data safe, confidential, and tamper-resistant
- Define what data is, how it drives business decisions, and how companies manage it
- Identify security threats like hacking, data theft, malware, and data leaks
- List other types of attack vectors used by cybercriminals

## CIA Triad

A comprehensive security program must contain confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These are known as the CIA Triad. 

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality means that data is protected from unauthorized access.

When confidential data is exposed beyond the intended audience, it causes risk. Confidential information is kept secret to prevent 
- identity theft
- compromised accounts and systems
- legal concerns
- damage to reputation
- other severe consequences

To determine if data should be confidential, ask: 
- Who is authorized?
- Do confidentiality regulations apply?
- Are there conditions for when data can be accessed?
- What would the impact of disclosure be? Is the data valuable?

Cybercriminals are always after sensitive information or personal data. To keep confidential data secure, control data access and use of security tools like encryption and multifactor authentication (MFA) is necessary.

### Integrity

Integrity means that data is protected from unauthorized changes.

Data is not static. It can be transferred to other systems, altered, and updated multiple times. Data integrity guarantees that data is accurate, complete, and consistent. 
It covers data in storage, during processing, and in transit. Without data integrity, loss, corruption, or compromise can cause significant damage and financial loss for both businesses and customers. 

The two main types of data integrity are physical and logical. 
- Physical data integrity is the collection of actions and fail safes that protect the physical systems that store and process the data.
- Logical data integrity are the checks and protocols that protect data from human error and hackers.
These confirm that data is correct and accurate as it’s used in different ways within an organization.

Unauthorized information alteration threatens the integrity of any process or outcome based on that information, including: 
- financial records
- vote totals
- health records
- news stories, and more.

Tools that fight unauthorized information alteration include: File integrity monitoring (or FIM), which audits sensitive files and folders to ensure all activity is authorized. And relational database management systems (or RDBMSs). An RDBMS is a database that records user access and data changes. RDBMS is safer than a spreadsheet program. 

To preserve data integrity, security plans must: 
- Prevent unauthorized user access
- Prevent unauthorized data changes by authorized users
- Use error checking and data validation

### Availability

Availability means you have access to your data whenever you need it. 
Data availability means that authorized users have immediate and reliable access to their data. This includes granting access to authorized users with passwords and security questions.
Some of the most fundamental threats to availability are non-malicious, including hardware failures, unscheduled software downtime, and network bandwidth issues. Malicious attacks against availability include various forms of sabotage intended to cause harm to an organization by denying users access to the information system. One such example would be a DoS (or Denial of Service) attack. 

To protect against these threats, systems that require high availability, (99.999% uptime) have: 
- network monitoring
- redundant hardware
- backup servers ready to take over.

There are regulatory standards, contracts, and local laws that companies and organizations must follow to secure and maintain data. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, Regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information in America. And the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, regulates digital privacy for all countries in the European Union. Fines and penalties for non-compliance help companies keep data safe, secure, accurate, and private.

## Security & Information Privacy

- When raw data is refined it becomes information. 
- Intellectual property (or IP) includes mind creations like designs, trade secrets, research discoveries, and even employee knowledge.
- Digital products are non-tangible assets that a company owns, like software, eBooks, or web elements.
- Data driven business decisions are based on capturing data, correlating it, and then using it to create meaningful reports.
- Classes of data that companies, and organizations must protect are personally identifiable information (or PII), company confidential information, customer confidential information, and protected health information (or PHI).

# Data Threats

## Data leaks 
Data leaks are the accidental exposure of confidential or sensitive data through a security vulnerability. 

## Data breaches
Data breaches are when a data leak is caused intentionally by a cybercriminals. These occur when social engineering or phishing attacks trick employees into leaking sensitive credentials or information. 

## Data dumps
Data dumps are when cybercriminals dump stolen data onto the dark web for monetary gain. 
A data dump might include PII, PHI, bank account numbers, PINs, social security numbers, and more. Other cybercriminals buy and use data dumps for things like identity theft and password attacks.
