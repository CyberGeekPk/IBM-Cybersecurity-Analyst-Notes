# Module 1 - Cybersecurity Insights

In this module, I learned about history of cybersecurity, along with insights into key events that influenced the global approach to cybersecurity. about critical thinking, its significance, and how it applies in real-world scenarios within cybersecurity. 
Additionally, I gained a clear understanding of the five key elements of the critical thinking model. Finally, I get into the five critical thinking skills that help form the foundation of critical thinking in every professional field, including cybersecurity.

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the events that led to the formulation of Americaâ€™s first cybersecurity policy, the National Security Decision Directives (NSDD 145).
- Summarize the exploitation of the internet in planning and executing the 9/11 attack, and outline the critical transformations in cybersecurity thereafter.
- Discuss the virtual shift prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and explain the reasons behind the surge in cybersecurity issues.
- Define critical thinking, its significance, and practical application in the field of cybersecurity.
- Describe the five key elements of the critical thinking model and their significance to cybersecurity professionals.
- Identify the five essential critical thinking skills foundational to all professional domains.

## The Impact of 9/11 on Cybersecurity

- Terrorists exploited the internet for communication, planning, information sharing, recruitment, and radicalization in preparation for the 9/11 attacks
- There was a surge in spamming website defacements and denial-of-service attacks following the 9/11 attacks
- The US government initiated several cybersecurity measures
- Establishment of the DHS
- Creation of the NCSD
- Enhancement of advanced encryption techniques for sensitive communications
- Introduction of the security by design concept
- Development of real-time global surveillance and nformation-sharing networks

## The Impact of COVID-19 on Cybersecurity

- COVID-19 pandemic expanded virtual operations, leading to a surge in cyberattacks
- There were several vulnerabilities associated with remote working
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies
- Less secure home Wi-Fi connections
- Increased risk of human error
- Attackers relentlessly targeted users and sectors with even the health sector falling prey
- A proactive cybersecurity community, vigilant, public and organizations willing to invest in cybersecurity infrastructure are collaborating to - safeguard our ever expanding virtual presence

## Critical Thinking in Cybersecurity
 
- Critical thinking involves objectively analyzing information and forming reasoned judgments
- Critical thinking forms the bedrock of effective cybersecurity, enabling professionals to make informed decisions, innovate, and anticipate threats
- You can employ critical thinking in cybersecurity to evaluate online information, engage in productive discussions, consider ethical aspects, navigate complex obstacles, perform root cause analysis, embrace new technologies, and pursue lifelong learning.

## Critical Thinking  Model

Critical thinking model has five elements
- Characteristics of thought
- Technical skills
- Interpersonal skills
- Theoretical and experimental knowledge
- Intellectual abilities
Critical thinking skills empower cybersecurity professionals to promptly detect breaches, communicate effectively, make informed decisions, and implement robust solutions. The critical thinking model offers a holistic approach to addressing cybersecurity challenges

## Critical Thinking - 5 Key Skills

Critical thinking is a complex process that requires integrating several vital skills. These skills enable us to process information efficiently, make logical decisions, and solve problems effectively. Here are the five pivotal critical thinking skills that help form the foundation of critical thinking in every professional field, including cybersecurity:

- The first skill is challenging assumptions. This means understanding that things are not always what they seem and that you need to dig deeper to get to the truth.
- The second skill is to consider alternatives. Thinking outside the box and considering alternative solutions, perspectives, or paths is fundamental to critical thinking. It prevents tunnel vision and promotes a more holistic understanding of the problem. 
- The third skill is evaluating data. Evaluating data involves the ability to analyze and interpret information objectively. It requires understanding the sources of your data, the methods of its collection, and the implications of that data.
- The fourth key skill is to identify key drivers. Critical thinkers can recognize the underlying forces or factors that drive a situation or influence an outcome. Key drivers might include the motivations of cybercriminals, the vulnerabilities of a system, or the potential impact of a breach. Identifying these drivers is crucial to helping to determine the future and developing an effective response strategy.
- The final key skill is understanding context. This involves understanding the larger picture or the circumstances surrounding a situation. It is about comprehending how different pieces fit together to form the whole. In a cybersecurity scenario, understanding context should mean considering how a specific threat fits into the broader cyberthreat landscape. Or how a company's cybersecurity practices align with industry standards and regulations. Understanding context also involves empathizing with different stakeholders to gain alternate perspectives. This practice could be likened to putting yourself in another person's shoes.This shift in perspective could unveil new strategies for defense and response, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.

These five skills form the backbone of effective critical thinking. They enable individuals to navigate complex problems and make informed, balanced decisions. In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, these skills are not just beneficial, they are essential for staying a step ahead of the threats and ensuring a secure digital environment.
