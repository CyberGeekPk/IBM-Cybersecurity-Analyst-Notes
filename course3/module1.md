# Module 1 - Cybersecurity Insights

In this module, I learned about history of cybersecurity, along with insights into key events that influenced the global approach to cybersecurity. about critical thinking, its significance, and how it applies in real-world scenarios within cybersecurity. 
Additionally, I gained a clear understanding of the five key elements of the critical thinking model. Finally, I get into the five critical thinking skills that help form the foundation of critical thinking in every professional field, including cybersecurity.

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the events that led to the formulation of Americaâ€™s first cybersecurity policy, the National Security Decision Directives (NSDD 145).
- Summarize the exploitation of the internet in planning and executing the 9/11 attack, and outline the critical transformations in cybersecurity thereafter.
- Discuss the virtual shift prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and explain the reasons behind the surge in cybersecurity issues.
- Define critical thinking, its significance, and practical application in the field of cybersecurity.
- Describe the five key elements of the critical thinking model and their significance to cybersecurity professionals.
- Identify the five essential critical thinking skills foundational to all professional domains.

## The Impact of 9/11 on Cybersecurity

- Terrorists exploited the internet for communication, planning, information sharing, recruitment, and radicalization in preparation for the 9/11 attacks
- There was a surge in spamming website defacements and denial-of-service attacks following the 9/11 attacks
- The US government initiated several cybersecurity measures
- Establishment of the DHS
- Creation of the NCSD
- Enhancement of advanced encryption techniques for sensitive communications
- Introduction of the security by design concept
- Development of real-time global surveillance and nformation-sharing networks

## The Impact of COVID-19 on Cybersecurity

- COVID-19 pandemic expanded virtual operations, leading to a surge in cyberattacks
- There were several vulnerabilities associated with remote working
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies
- Less secure home Wi-Fi connections
- Increased risk of human error
- Attackers relentlessly targeted users and sectors with even the health sector falling prey
- A proactive cybersecurity community, vigilant, public and organizations willing to invest in cybersecurity infrastructure are collaborating to - safeguard our ever expanding virtual presence

## Critical Thinking in Cybersecurity
 
- Critical thinking involves objectively analyzing information and forming reasoned judgments
- Critical thinking forms the bedrock of effective cybersecurity, enabling professionals to make informed decisions, innovate, and anticipate threats
- You can employ critical thinking in cybersecurity to evaluate online information, engage in productive discussions, consider ethical aspects, navigate complex obstacles, perform root cause analysis, embrace new technologies, and pursue lifelong learning.

## Critical Thinking  Model

Critical thinking model has five elements
- Characteristics of thought
- Technical skills
- Interpersonal skills
- Theoretical and experimental knowledge
- Intellectual abilities
Critical thinking skills empower cybersecurity professionals to promptly detect breaches, communicate effectively, make informed decisions, and implement robust solutions. The critical thinking model offers a holistic approach to addressing cybersecurity challenges

## Critical Thinking: 5 Key Skills

- Five pivotal critical thinking skills help form the foundation of critical thinking in every professional field, including cybersecurity
- Challenging assumptions, means understanding that things are not always what they seem and that you need to dig deeper to get to the truth.
- When considering alternatives, the second skill is to methodically brainstorm the full range of possibilities and break them into components, who, what, when, where, why, and how
- The third skill, evaluating data, involves the ability to analyze and interpret information objectively
- The fourth skill is identifying key drivers. That means critical thinkers can recognize the underlying forces or factors that drive a situation or influence an outcome
- Understanding context. The fifth skill is about comprehending how different pieces fit together to form the whole in a cybersecurity scenario.
