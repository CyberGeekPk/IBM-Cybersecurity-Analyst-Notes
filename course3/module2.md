# Cybersecurity Threats

## Learning Objectives
- Define and classify threat actors based on their motives.
- Identify steps to protect your data and organization by analyzing insights from the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index and 2024 cybersecurity trends.
- Describe malware and the process by which a bad actor can make and distribute malware.
- Define ransomware and explore strategies to prevent ransomware attacks.
- Define malware and explain ways to prevent malware attacks.
- Describe various methods hackers use to hack into a complex system.
- Examine and differentiate between phishing, vishing, and smishing techniques.
- Identify the best ways to protect yourself and your organization from AI-based phishing attacks.

## Types of Actors and Their Motives
- A threat actor is an individual or a group responsible for actions that could compromise a computer network or system.
- There are different groups of threat actors, hacktivists, organized crime syndicates, nation state actors, script kiddies, and insider threat actors.
- Threat actors are driven by varied motives like financial gain, political agendas, espionage, or an intent to cause disruption and chaos.
- It's critical to study the varied landscape of threat actors to develop effective cybersecurity strategies and address their ever-evolving risks.

## IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index?
The IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, an annual report created through extensive analysis of security events, provides insights into the current cybersecurity landscape. The report tracks changes, analyzes security trends and patterns, identifies emerging threats and vulnerabilities, and provides strategic guidance to help organizations strengthen their security posture and defend against cyberattacks.

The IBM X-ForceThreat Intelligence Index 2024 is based on insights and observations from examining over 150 billion security events per day in over 130 countries. In this activity, you will research and review the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2024 to gain insights into cybersecurity trends and the threat landscape.

## How to Prevent Malware Attacks
- There are seven ways to prevent malware attacks.
- Update OS and software
- Install a trusted antivirus
- Ensure password security
- Exercise caution with emails
- Exercise caution with downloads
- Back up data
- Educate users
Organizations can prevent large-scale attacks by implementing an e-mail gateway and training users.

## Malware Detection with Rootkit Hunters
Estimated reading time: 2 minutes

### What is a rootkit?
A rootkit refers to malicious software hackers use to gain administrator access to a target system. They then leverage this privileged access to remotely carry out various malicious activities, such as manipulating system configurations and modifying or deleting critical data.

Hackers commonly deploy rootkits to operate stealthily. These rootkits conceal their presence and mask the activities of other malware, like keyloggers and spyware, to evade detection by antivirus software and system administrators.

## What is a rootkit hunter (rkhunter)?
A rootkit hunter, commonly called rkhunter, is a valuable tool that helps security professionals protect Linux/Unix-based systems against malware attacks. Rkhunter detects various types of malware, including rootkits, backdoors, and other potential vulnerabilities or local exploits.

### How does rkhunter scan for malware?
Rkhunter scans for malware by thoroughly inspecting critical system components and comparing them against a database containing known signatures and behavioral patterns of common malicious software.

### Rkhunter operates by:

Scanning file systems to identify anomalies
Detecting rootkits by comparing the output of system commands
Identifying unauthorized remote access tools or backdoors
Auditing system configurations to detect any misconfigurations
Providing detailed reports of suspicious activity and recommended remediation actions
One of the main advantages of rkhunter is that it can run scans on demand and alert administrators to any unusual activity within a server's file system.

### How can you maximize security?
While rkhunter is an essential server security tool, it is recommended to combine rkhunter with other tools and practices like intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewall configurations, systematic software updates, user access controls, and secure network policies to maximize security.
