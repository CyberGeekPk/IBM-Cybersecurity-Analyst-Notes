# Module 2 - Windows Security

## Active Directory Accounts and Security Considerations
- AD functions as a comprehensive organizational tool within Windows Server environments.
- A Domain Admin account holds significant authority and control within an AD domain.
- In a Windows server environment, user accounts play a crucial role as unique identifiers for system access.
- Windows server operating system or OS, supports various types of user accounts.
- Default local accounts serve certain key functions.

## Windows Security Settings
UAC features enhance security and protect against unauthorized changes and malware, BitLocker encrypts system and data drives, while BitLocker to Go extends BitLocker encryption to removable storage devices, and EFS automatically encrypts and decrypts files and folders on NTFS volumes.

## User Management and Permissions
User accounts and groups provide a way to control authentication and access to files, folders, applications, and network services. The difference between running an application or command as an administrator versus a standard user on Windows lies in the level of permissions and privileges granted to each account type. You should use NTFS to set permissions on individual files and folders within an NTFS partition, and use share permissions to provide access to shared folders over a network.
