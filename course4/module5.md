# Project overview - System Administration and Security

## Scenario:
Cyber Secure Inc. recently hired you as a junior cybersecurity analyst. Other businesses contract Cyber Secure Inc. to handle their system administration and security.

Suppose my supervisor assigned me six tickets; the first three require work with Windows OS, and the other three require me to work with Linux.

The project has two parts. For part 1, I will use the Rhyme lab environment in Coursera, which emulates a Windows Operating System. 
For part 2, I will use the Skills Network Cloud IDE environment, which provides access to a Linux terminal.

## Part 1: Windows tickets
- Add a new user to a new group
- Update and run virus and threat protection
- Configure firewall and network protection

## Part 2: Linux tickets
- Create a new user
- Manage files and folders
- Apply system updates
