# Project overview - System Administration and Security

## Scenario:
Cyber Secure Inc. recently hired you as a junior cybersecurity analyst. Other businesses contract Cyber Secure Inc. to handle their system administration and security.

Suppose my supervisor assigned me six tickets; the first three require work with Windows OS, and the other three require me to work with Linux.

The project has two parts. For part 1, I will use the Rhyme lab environment in Coursera, which emulates a Windows Operating System. 
For part 2, I will use the Skills Network Cloud IDE environment, which provides access to a Linux terminal.

## Part 1: Windows tickets
- Add a new user to a new group
- Update and run virus and threat protection
- Configure firewall and network protection

## Part 2: Linux tickets
- Create a new user
- Manage files and folders
- Apply system updates

## Ticket 1: Create a new user
In this task, I will use Microsoft Windows Server Manager to create a new user and group and then add the user to the group.

- Open Server Manager
- Create a new user named after one of your favorite cartoon characters.
- Set a secure password.
- Create a new group named Accounting.

## Ticket 2: Check for virus and threat protection updates
In this task, I will use the Windows operating system to check for virus and threat protection updates and run a "Quick Scan".

- Check for updates to virus and threat protection.
- Take a screenshot that shows the date for the protection updates.
- Run a Quick Scan using Windows Security.

## Ticket 3: Configure firewall and network protection
Access Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security to create a new rule with following properties.
a. A port rule that controls connections for a TCP port on port 80
b. Allow the connection on Domain, Private, and Public
