# Module 4 : macOS & Virtualization
In this module, you will learn about macOS, its features, preferences, and how to upgrade it. You will also learn the differences between iOS and Android. The module will cover fundamental concepts of virtualization and cloud computing. You will also have the opportunity to explore macOS features, create a virtual machine simulation, and explore containers, Docker, and IBM Cloud through hands-on labs.

## Learning Objectives
- Describe how Time Machine, a built-in feature in macOS, backs up your files
- List five macOS features and their applications
- Use macOS system preferences to customize your macOS experience
- Define virtualization and describe how it works to simplify IT management
- Describe how cloud computing enables remote access, storage, and management of data over the internet
- Compare and contrast containers, virtual machines, and Docker technology

## Mac OS Overview
MacOS released Big Sur in 2020, the first major version increment since macOSX released in 2001. File types specific to MacOS include dot dmg files, dot pkg files, and dot app files. Apple provides individual users AppleIDs for managing devices for personal use, whereas businesses use “Managed Apple IDs” for managing devices in a corporate environment MDMs let businesses remotely manage control devices, enforce security policies, distribute apps, and track device usage via Managed Apple IDs. The built-in time machine app lets you automate system backup to an external storage device.

## MacOS Features
macOS has an array of features and tools that will enable users to streamline their workflows and safeguard their data. The different macOS features include multiple desktops, the Mission Control, Keychain, Spotlight, iCloud, Multi-touch gestures, Remote Disk, the Dock, FileVault, the Disk Utility tool, and the Terminal window

## Mac OS System Preferences
System Preferences in macOS is the hub for managing various system settings. System preference settings help you improve functionality and security and create a personalized macOS environment that suits your needs.

## Introduction to Mobile Devices: iOS
Organizations appreciates Apple’s security, data privacy practices and seamless interoperability with other iOS and Mac devices. The Settings app is where you can adjust iOS settings and check storage and performance-related information. The three main iOS device screen names are the Home screen, the Today View, and the App Library. Siri, Apple’s digital assistant, works with both voice and keyboard input. And the About settings page provides device, communication, and cellular identifying information.

## Introduction to Mobile Devices: Android
Organizations appreciate Android’s security, data privacy practices, and seamless interoperability with an open ecosystem of providers and devices. The Settings app is where you can adjust Android settings, configure cellular service, view essential device information, and update the operating system. You can manually check for Android security updates at any time, and Android device owners receive a notification that an update is available, and can choose to install the updates immediately or later.

## An Overview of Virtualization
Virtualization is a technology that optimizes the use of physical computer hardware by creating VMs through software. Virtualization offers numerous benefits, including improved security, disaster recovery, cost savings, and operational efficiency. Virtualization uses specialized software called a hypervisor to create virtual machines on one physical computer. VMs are digital replicas of real computers that operate in virtual environments. Virtualization brings about a new era in computing where the emphasis is shifted from physical assets to virtual resources through desktop virtualization, network virtualization, storage virtualization, data virtualization, application virtualization, data center virtualization, and CPU virtualization. This paradigm change makes virtualization an essential tool for IT professionals and enterprises worldwide, as it not only opens the door for creative cloud solutions, but also supports the contemporary digital economy.

## An Overview of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to delivering of computing resources over the internet on a pay-per-use basis. Compared to traditional on-premises IT setups, Cloud computing offers many benefits, such as cost-saving, scalability, flexibility, and data prevention. Cloud computing relies on data centers for infrastructure, high speed networking for connectivity, and virtualization for resource efficiency. Cloud computing provides services through IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, and serverless approach. A cloud deployment model is a specific type of cloud environment. There are three types of cloud: private, public, and hybrid.

## Introduction to Containers
Organizations are moving to containers to overcome challenges around isolation, utilization, provisioning, performance, and more. A container is a standard unit of software that encapsulates everything needed to build, ship, and run applications. Containers are operating system, programming language, and platform-independent. They lower deployment time and costs, improve utilization, automate processes, and support next-gen applications (microservices). Developers may find that management, legacy project migration, and right-sizing are significant challenges. And finally, major container vendors include Docker, Podman, LXC, and Vagrant.

## Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications as containers. Docker speeds up the deployment process across multiple environments. Docker uses namespaces technology to provide an isolated workspace called the “container.” Docker creates a set of namespaces for every container and each aspect runs in a separate namespace with access limited to that namespace. Docker supports Agile and CI/CD DevOps practices, and lastly, Docker containers are not a good fit for applications based on monolithic architecture or applications that require high performance or security.
