# Module 4 - Injection Vulnerabilities
In this module, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of injection vulnerabilities, a critical area in database security. You will learn about injection flaws, setting the stage for a deeper understanding of various types of injections. Further, you will explore OS command injection and learn about different techniques and their implications for system security. You will also be introduced to SQL injection, its mechanisms, and impacts. Additionally, you will gain insight into other types of injection vulnerabilities, broadening your understanding of potential threats. You will also review additional resources that provide detailed guidelines and standards for understanding, identifying, and mitigating injection vulnerabilities. You will have the hands-on opportunity to perform SQL injection testing to evaluate the security of an application.

# DEEP DIVE INJECTION VULNERABILITIES

## Introduction to Injection Flaws 
Injection flaws allow attackers to relay malicious code through the vulnerable application to another system. You also learned that they have been consistently rated as the most dangerous type of vulnerability across lists like OS Top 10 and SANS Top 25. Finally, you learned that injection vulnerabilities have been responsible for attacks like the Equifax Hack and the Hack of TalkTalk.
