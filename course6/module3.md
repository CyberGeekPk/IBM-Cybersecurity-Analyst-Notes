Additionally, you will explore a range of methods to secure data, including encryption, hashing, masking, tokenization, obfuscation, segmentation, and permission restrictions. You will be able to apply these concepts practically through hands-on labs focused on data security, user management, access control, and encryption. The module ends with a summary of key points and highlights, reinforcing the concepts discussed.

# STRATEGIES TO PROTECT DATA

## Data Types
Data refers to information, including factual details or numerical values collected for categorization, analysis, and decision making. There are different types of data, each serving a unique purpose. These include trade secrets, intellectual property, IP, legal information, financial information, and human- and non-human-readable data. Trade secrets are confidential practices and processes that give a company a competitive edge. Intellectual property, IP, refers to legal constructs that give creators exclusive rights to their inventions and creative works. Legal information refers to highly sensitive data subject to strict confidentiality and integrity standards. Financial information includes bank statements, transaction records, tax documents, and payroll data that require rigorous protection. Human-readable data includes text documents, spreadsheets, and emails stored in formats easily understood by users. Non-human-readable data includes binary files, encrypted data, and system logs that require machine processing for interpretation. Finally, you learned that understanding different data type's unique characteristics and security requirements is essential for protecting sensitive information.

## Data Classifications
Data classification is the process of categorizing or organizing data based on its sensitivity and potential impact. Sensitive data consists of information that could harm an individual or organization if disclosed. Confidential data refers to information that an organization or group intends to keep secret from the public. Public data is meant for public access and does not need protection from unauthorized access. Restricted data includes information not meant for public access and is accessible only to specific individuals or groups. Private data refers to personal information that individuals intend to keep confidential. Critical data includes information vital for an organization's operation and survival. Finally, you learned that by properly categorizing data, organizations can apply tailored security measures to preserve data integrity and mitigate the risks of unauthorized access or breaches.

## General Data Protection Considerations
Effective data management and protection require understanding several key considerations such as data states, data sovereignty, and geolocation. Data exists in three states. These are data at rest, data in transit, and data in use. Data sovereignty includes complying with country specific data protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA, and includes considerations like legal compliance and data localization. Geolocation helps to enhance data protection by implementing access controls, ensuring data residency, and improving security monitoring based on locations. Finally, you learnt that organizations should maintain data security by implementing encryption, access controls, secure communication monitoring, and compliance strategies.

## Methods of Securing Data: 
Key data protection methods, their implementation and benefits, geographic restrictions limit access based on location, reducing cross-border risks, and ensuring compliance with data sovereignty regulations. Encryption protects data confidentiality by converting it into an unreadable format without a decryption key. Hashing maintains data integrity by converting data into a non-reversible fixed size string. Masking hide sensitive data for testing and development, preventing exposure while allowing realistic use.
key data protection methods, how they are implemented, and the benefits they offer. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with tokens, reducing the risk of exposure and protecting data during transactions. Obfuscation makes data or code difficult to understand for unauthorized users, safeguarding intellectual property and sensitive information. Segmentation isolates different types of data to enhance security and simplify management. Finally, you learn that permission restrictions control access based on user roles and use attributes-based access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

# DATABASE SECURITY

## Database User Profiles, Password Policies, Privileges and Roles
Essential considerations for database user security include creating and maintaining user profiles, implementing strong password policies, and assigning appropriate privileges. Securing user profiles involves using unique accounts and defining explicit profile attributes. To strengthen password security, create complex passwords, enforce regular changes, and implement multi-factor authentication. Privilege management requires granting users only necessary privileges, regularly reviewing permissions, and promptly revoking outdated access. Using roles to group privileges simplifies management and enhances security by assigning permissions based on job functions. Implementing segregation of duties, auditing user activity, and adopting the privilege principle further strengthens database security.

## Design and Implement Database Application Security Models 
Key principles of database security models include confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization, and auditing. Designing a strong security model involves identifying security requirements, defining security policies, implementing security control, and aligning with industry standards. Identifying security requirements involves classifying data sensitivity, complying with regulations, and assessing potential threats. Defining security policies involves establishing access controls, encryption protocols, backup procedures, and incident response plans. Implementing security controls includes focusing on data encryption, auditing, and monitoring. Finally, you learned that the database security model aligns with industry standards and best practices.

## Design and Implement Database Auditing Models
Database auditing is crucial for ensuring data integrity, enhancing security and complying with regulations. Core principles for effective database auditing include accountability, transparency, compliance, forensic analysis, and operational insights. Designing a comprehensive database auditing model involves identifying requirements, defining policies, and constructing the audit trail. Implementing auditing mechanisms requires configuring database auditing features and integrating with external tools. Finally, you learned that the best practices for database auditing include ensuring data integrity, protecting audit logs, and conducting regular reviews.

## Application Data Auditing 
Application data auditing tracks and records data access and changes within an application, maintaining data integrity, security, and regulatory compliance. Design strategies for auditing include identifying sensitive data, determining relevant regulations and auditing requirements, and assessing security risks and needs. Defining auditing policies outlines the scope, details, retention, and access controls for audit logs. To integrate auditing mechanisms, identify crucial points in the application where auditing should occur, add logging functionality to capture relevant details, and use middleware to centralize logging and manage auditing. Database management systems provide built-in auditing capabilities such as automatically logging changes, capturing detailed information about database transactions, and consolidating and managing audit logs. Best practices for application data auditing, including ensuring comprehensive coverage, maintaining accurate timestamps, implementing robust access controls, and conducting regular reviews.

## Auditing Database Activities 
Auditing database activities is a vital practice for ensuring data integrity, security, and compliance for designing and implementing database auditing strategies. Identify auditing requirements, that is, understand the specific needs and regulatory requirements for auditing within your database. Define auditing policies, that is, establish clear policies outlining what needs to be audited and how audit data will be managed. Implement auditing mechanisms by configuring DBMS auditing features and leveraging database triggers. Finally, follow best practices to ensure the completeness, accuracy, and protection of audit logs and conduct regular reviews and analyses. By following these guidelines and best practices, organizations can design and implement effective database auditing models that enhance security, ensure compliance, and provide valuable operational insights.
