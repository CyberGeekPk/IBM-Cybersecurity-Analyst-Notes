# Module 3 - Database Securit & Data Protection Strategies  
In this module, you will delve into the critical aspects of data security and database vulnerabilities, equipping you with the knowledge and skills required to protect sensitive information. You will begin with an in-depth exploration of database injection vulnerabilities and learn about common threats and mitigation strategies. You will also learn about various data types, classifications, and general data protection considerations essential for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. Additionally, you will explore a range of methods to secure data, including encryption, hashing, masking, tokenization, obfuscation, segmentation, and permission restrictions. You will be able to apply these concepts practically through hands-on labs focused on data security, user management, access control, and encryption. The module ends with a summary of key points and highlights, reinforcing the concepts discussed.

## Data Types
Data refers to information, including factual details or numerical values collected for categorization, analysis, and decision making. There are different types of data, each serving a unique purpose. These include trade secrets, intellectual property, IP, legal information, financial information, and human- and non-human-readable data. Trade secrets are confidential practices and processes that give a company a competitive edge. Intellectual property, IP, refers to legal constructs that give creators exclusive rights to their inventions and creative works. Legal information refers to highly sensitive data subject to strict confidentiality and integrity standards. Financial information includes bank statements, transaction records, tax documents, and payroll data that require rigorous protection. Human-readable data includes text documents, spreadsheets, and emails stored in formats easily understood by users. Non-human-readable data includes binary files, encrypted data, and system logs that require machine processing for interpretation. Finally, you learned that understanding different data type's unique characteristics and security requirements is essential for protecting sensitive information.

## Data Classifications
Data classification is the process of categorizing or organizing data based on its sensitivity and potential impact. Sensitive data consists of information that could harm an individual or organization if disclosed. Confidential data refers to information that an organization or group intends to keep secret from the public. Public data is meant for public access and does not need protection from unauthorized access. Restricted data includes information not meant for public access and is accessible only to specific individuals or groups. Private data refers to personal information that individuals intend to keep confidential. Critical data includes information vital for an organization's operation and survival. Finally, you learned that by properly categorizing data, organizations can apply tailored security measures to preserve data integrity and mitigate the risks of unauthorized access or breaches.
