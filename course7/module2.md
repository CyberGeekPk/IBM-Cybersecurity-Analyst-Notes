# Module 2 - Access Management & Endpoint Security
This module introduces Identity and access management (IAM) and endpoints. IAM is one of the security domains and is referred to as the new perimeter. You will learn about the LDAP and the 4 Aâ€™s of IAM including administration, authorization, authentication, and audits. After a brief discussion on Privileged access management (PAM), you will be introduced to the concepts of multifactor authentication (MFA) and single sign on (SSO). You will also learn about endpoints, which is another key security domain. After learning the definition of an endpoint, you will be introduced to endpoint management systems, which help control the endpoints.

## Key Takeaways: Identity Access Management

- IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a web service that securely controls access to resources.
### 4As of Identity and access management:
- Administration: It involves determining the current access rights and also creating them. Administration involves creating, updating, and deleting accounts.
- Authentication: It involves determining the identity of the person who needs access.
- Authorization: It involves determining what should be done and what shouldn't be done
- Audit: It involves analysis of the three A's (above) and ensuring that it is adhered to.

- Any information about a user is called identity.
- The place a user identity is saved is referred to as a directory.
- A directory comprises of a database, a schema, a protocol (most commonly used, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)).
### Ways to approach Synchronization:
- Virtual directory: It retrieves the information based on the request sent by the user.
- Meta directory: It takes the information, pre-fetches it, and stores it up to an enterprise directory.
- Privilege Access Management (PAM) monitors and prevents unauthorized privileged access to critical resources.
- A federation capability helps to log in a system as an identity provider and access other systems as a service provider.
- Workforce identity management refers to the processes, tools, and strategies used to manage the workforce.
- Consumer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is used to integrate both authentication and authorization into customer-facing applications.
