# Module 3 - Network, Application and Data Security
In this module, you will be introduced to security in the network, application and data domains. As part of the network security domain, you will gain insight into firewall concepts, such as packet filter, stateful packet inspection, and proxy. You will also be introduced to security concepts associated with segments and VPNs, and SASE. Moving to the Application security domain, you will get familiar with the phases when security vulnerabilities creep in along with best practices for secure coding along with introduction of vulnerability testing. The concept of DevSecOps, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) will also be introduced. This module will conclude with concepts associated with data security including governance, discovery, compliance, detection, and response.

## Network Security
Network security helps to protect the usability and integrity of data using firewalls to differentiate between trusted and untrusted networks.

- Packet filtering helps to pass or block data packets in a network using firewalls.
- Data packets contain information on the source address, the destination address, and the port to use.
- Stateful packet inspection helps to evaluate the packets that can be allowed through the firewall. It also looks at the packet contents.
- An application firewall helps to monitor and control the incoming and outgoing network traffic that follows a set of predefined rules.
- A proxy acts on behalf of another party or format. It helps to inspect and enforce a security policy on data.
- Network Address Translation (NAT) helps to map multiple IPs to one another. It helps improve security by translating an internal address that cannot be routed across the internet.
- Virtual Private Networking (VPN) provides a secure channel over an untrusted network. A secure shell is an example of a VPN.
- IPSec is implemented in the network layer to encrypt the communication between two network addresses.
- Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) combines VPN and other networks and delivers them as a single cloud service.
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is the practice of detecting and protecting data breaches.
