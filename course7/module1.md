# Module 1 : Cybersecurity Architecture Overview
In this module, you will be introduced to fundamental principles of cybersecurity including defense in depth, least privilege, separation of duties, security by design, Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). You will also be introduced to bad practice Security by Obscurity that can lead to cyberattacks. Next, you will be able to recognize the importance and key concepts related to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, or the CIA Triad. Finally, you will become familiar with roles and how to manage the role security.

## Five Principles to Follow (and One to Avoid)

- ### 1. Defense in depth
Defense in depth is trying to create an obstacle course, a difficulty for the bad guy. You can see what I've done here is there's no single security mechanism that is protecting this thing. If any one of these fails, the rest of the system still works. That's the idea that we're after here. If you think about it this way, we've got no single point of failure. We're trying to avoid single points of failure. We want a system that ultimately if it fails, it fails safe. That's what we're trying to get, and that's what the old model and the new model of securities were designed to do. 

- ### 2. Principle of least privilege
Principle of least privilege basically says, I'm only going to give access rights to people that need that, that are authorized and need it in order to do their job and can justify it, and for only as long as they need that access right.
